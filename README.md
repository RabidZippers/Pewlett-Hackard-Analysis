# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this challenge was to find all current employees who are eligible for retirement. A query was then made to find all the employess who meet a certain criteria to mentor fellow employees
## Results
* Off the 300,000 total employees, over 133,000 are eligible for retirement.
* Senior Engineers make up about 25,000 employees eligible for retirement out of the 300,000 employees.
* Around 50,000 Senior level employes are eligible for retirement out of the 300,000 employees
* Only 1500 employees are eligible to be mentors
## Summary
Retirement is fast approaching for a little under 50% of the company. There are not enough employees to mentor unless they each carry a load of trainees teetering on 100 mentees. A mentoring program or cross training program should be created as to curb the possibility for employees lacking the skills to replace those leaving or to mentor the new employees who are replacing the employees retiring.
